this replay handles realtime waves creation, filtering and ring modulation
there is no huge memory pre-calculations like in the original amiga or windows player, all is realtime calculated by the dsp
if you don't use ring modulation and if you use 10 channels or less, all fits in the DSP memory, so just a few bytes are read from central RAM, 50 times per second.
this way, hively is less heavy for the other parts of your demo/game than any protracker module
